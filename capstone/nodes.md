Open problems in SAEs (Sparse Autoencoders) and superposition can vary depending on the specific context or application. However, here are a few common challenges and open questions in these areas:

1. Robustness to noisy data: SAEs and superposition techniques often struggle with handling noisy or corrupted input data. How can these models be made more robust to noise and maintain good reconstruction quality?

2. Handling large-scale or high-dimensional data: Scaling up SAEs and superposition methods to effectively handle large datasets or high-dimensional inputs remains an open problem. How can these techniques be efficiently applied to big data scenarios?

3. Improving the interpretability of learned representations: While SAEs can efficiently learn abstract representations, the interpretability and meaningfulness of these representations are often limited. How can we design SAE architectures that yield more interpretable features?

4. Incorporating domain knowledge: Integrating prior knowledge about the problem domain into the SAE architecture is challenging. How can domain knowledge be effectively incorporated to guide the learning process?

5. Adapting SAEs for semi-supervised and unsupervised learning: SAEs are primarily used for unsupervised learning, but there is ongoing research to extend them for semi-supervised or weakly-supervised learning. How can we design SAEs that effectively leverage limited labeled data?

When it comes to finding good papers to replicate and learn from for your capstone project, it ultimately depends on your specific goals and interests within SAEs and superposition. Nevertheless, here are a few pioneering papers in the area that can serve as a starting point:
