# ARENA 3.0

Notes, code, and work from my time at [ARENA 3.0](https://arena.education) at the London Institute for Safe AI, to upskill technical AI skills, covering topics like transformers, mech interp, RL, and implementations of math components. Mostly for my own reference.

Go to **capstone** ([link](https://github.com/ClaireBookworm/arena/tree/master/capstone)) folder to find capstone projectâ€”a truthfullness probe and model steering project.
